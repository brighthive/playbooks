title: Conduct privacy risk assessments
---

When responsible organizations identify new ways to collect or use personal data, they utilize privacy impact assessments (PIAs) to systematically identify and address potential privacy issues. Given the volume and sensitivity of personal information required for effective pandemic response, including information related to health status, location and mobility, and employment, DCTT initiatives must proactively identify, document, and mitigate potential privacy risks. Best practices, frameworks, and tools for conducting privacy and data protection impact assessments are well-established in both the public and private sectors.

### Checklist
1. Conduct a PIA as early as possible, before the DCTT initiative collects or handles any personal information.
2. Document any potential privacy risks identified by the PIA and how they will be addressed or mitigated by the initiative, including its partners and service providers.
3. Complement a privacy risk assessment with a data benefit assessment, so that the benefits and risks to individuals, communities, and society as a whole can be considered holistically. 
4. Articulate any countervailing policies or factors that justify accepting whatever residual privacy risks remain.
5. Publish privacy risk and benefit assessments for public review. 
6. Review PIAs on a regular basis, and update them whenever there is a material change in how personal information is handled.

### Key Questions
- Who within the DCTT initiative will be responsible for conducting PIAs and where will it be stored?
- Will there be an opportunity for individuals or community stakeholders to participate in the PIA process, such as by helping identify unintended consequences?
- Is there a mechanism in place to trigger re-review of the initiative (e.g., when there has been a material change to the way data is collected or used, semi-annually, etc.)?
- Will the final risk assessment be made available to the public?
