# Not for Publication: Playbook Launch Scheduled for Tuesday, July 21, 10am
# Responsible Data Use Playbook for Job Seeker Tools

### Introduction
Public and private agencies of all kinds have long attempted to develop useful job seeker tools. The massive unemployment crisis caused by COVID-19 highlights the urgent need for a more synchronized response from the philanthropic, private, and public sectors to enhance job seekers’ experiences and ultimately bridge the gap between available talent and workforce demand. Now more than ever, job seekers need a collaborative approach grounded in the lived experiences of the people struggling in the labor market today. We need to put their needs front and center and provide them more relevant, actionable information and support. 

Newly laid-off workers do not have the technologies and tools they need to analyze their talents, highlight their expertise, and assess their skill gaps. They need information about how to choose the right career pathways for their goals and how to develop the skills needed to begin or continue their progress along those pathways. Job seekers want guidance on which pathways will be most effective, affordable, and targeted to help them grow and thrive in the labor market. They also need wraparound support services to help make sense of the sheer volume of available resources and make the best decisions possible.

The Responsible Data Use Playbook for Job Seeker Tools is intended to provide private sector actors, state and local governments, and the philanthropic community with guidelines to develop the most effective job seeker tools for newly laid-off workers. At the core of these tools is a commitment to data sharing and data governance, which are critical to providing job seekers with access to accurate information on labor markets and training opportunities. These plays serve as a framework for how to design initiatives and tools for workers, how to identify organizations critical to the implementation of this design, and how to create sustainable governance of those tools and resources. This is how we begin to build stronger engines of social and economic mobility. 

In this playbook, you will find four guiding principles and seven plays—each illuminated through real-life examples. We hope that over time, the community will continue to offer suggestions for other useful examples of progress.

### Guiding Principles
This playbook was developed using four guiding principles to ground the overall vision and each of the plays. 
1. Job seeker experience and needs should be the focus, and should include support, guidance, and advising in addition to digital tools and resources.
2. Equity, and eliminating equity gaps, should be a central goal.
3. Cross-sector collaborations can produce the most effective results.
4. Tools should be built with longevity and sustainability in mind. 

### Guiding Use Cases
The highest priority use cases for jobseeker tools at this time revolve around: 
- **Mapping** out all the job opportunities and credentialing programs in a region
- **Measuring** the market value of the available credentialing programs and in-demand skills
- **Aligning** on pathways to opportunity that fill local needs and meet the job seekers where they are 
- **Recommending** specific pathways to individuals given the skills and credentials they've got and their goals, and 
- **Coordinating** on wraparound supports among service providers (e.g. health, housing, childcare) to ensure the pathway is accessible and feasible for those most in need.

### Examples of States at Work
As state and local governments, non-profit organizations, private vendors, and philanthropic organizations seek to provide the best information and resources for job seekers, here are a few approaches that exhibit best practices.

#### Arizona
ARIZONA@WORK is a collaborative effort of the Arizona Department of Economic Security, Arizona Commerce Authority, Arizona Office of Economic Opportunity, and local workforce areas. It provides job seekers with a suite of tools, including a resume builder, targeted job search functions, and information about market trends. The tool highlights high-demand occupations to address the current labor market needs in the state, and the user interface is attractive and intuitive. The portal, which is itself an innovative solution for job seekers, is also supported by a statewide outreach effort, and the preliminary data suggest that outreach has been successful.

#### Colorado
Part of the Data for American Dream initiative, My Colorado Journey is powered by a new, multi-agency, public-private data trust that, over time, will both unite the existing fragmented ecosystem of data in Colorado and allow for the creation of new datasets that connect services, programs, and education and employment opportunities. Similarly, the My Colorado Journey platform takes a fragmented set of end-user experiences across agencies and provides a unified and personalized user interface platform, rooted in a strong partnership between multiple state government agencies, private vendors, and local philanthropy. By involving partners from a variety of sectors, Colorado ensured both that the needs of many user types are represented in the design of the initiative, and that users from each of these types are recruited to both test and utilize the tool. 

#### New Jersey
In New Jersey, the current job seeker solution is a trio of tools. New Jersey was one of the first states to stand up a rapid response effort to help those laid off as a result of COVID-19 days within the declaration of the public health emergency. The pre-COVID-19 job seeker solution is the New Jersey Career Network, a digital coaching tool that helps people navigate their job search. Finally, there is a more targeted approach for low-income, lower skilled, and under- and unemployed individuals being developed as part of the Data for the American Dream initiative. The New Jersey Career Network and Data for the American Dream initiatives are led by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development; the COVID-19 rapid response effort was led by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority in consultation with Labor. The Governor’s Innovation Office is the digital lead on all three of these tools.This approach will help the state ensure that it meets the demands of different audiences of job seekers in the state.
